                        His Dream
                    </h2>

                        Brainy loves to learn about the stars and planets. He dreams of one day becoming an astronaut and exploring the vastness of space.

Every night, Brainy would gaze up at the sky and imagine himself soaring through the cosmos. He pictures himself visiting the moon, landing on Mars, and even traveling to other galaxies.

Brainy knows that becoming an astronaut would be a challenge, but he is determined to make his dream a reality. He studies hard in school and excelles in science and math. He also has joined the astronomy club and volunteered at the local planetarium.

One day, Brainy's dream came one step closer to reality when he was selected to participate in a summer camp for aspiring astronauts. At camp, Brainy learned about the basics of spaceflight and experienced what it was like to train like an astronaut.

Brainy's passion for space exploration never wavered. He continued to work hard and pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut. He knew that it would take a lot of dedication and perseverance, but he was confident that he could achieve his goal.
